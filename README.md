# Not fast just furious: Shopping list
> By Maria Kailahti and Nikola Simovic â”ƒ @mariakailahti @Nikola-Simovic

Welcome to our final project for the Web Software Production course. We are developing a comprehensive shopping list application, showcasing our proficiency in full-stack development. Our project's CI/CD pipeline, and everything from the frontend to the backend as well as the API itself, has been built using the tools and methods we learned in the course. This project represents our journey in this year's full-stack development.

*On a final note from the creators, the project has been moved to this repository after it's final version has been completed elsewhere, so unfortunately the only release available will be the newest 1.0.0 one.

*As of the current date (28.01.2024), the code is being hosted on official university servers. While the website is fully functioning and can still be accessed via the address in this ReadMe file, we cannot guarantee its availability in the future. It's important to note that, unlike the server address, the IP address is accessible only to those with the proper VPN access.

*Due to the nature of the project, some parts of the build and deploy phase had to be modified or removed when moving to a new repository. In order to ensure clarity after the move, all larger changes have been thoroughly commented in the source code itself.

## Server information

Server address: https://23wsp-pro12.course.tamk.cloud/

The IP address: 172.16.6.26


Ports:
* frontend: 172.16.6.26:8000
* backend 172.16.6.26:4000


Endpoint:  https://23wsp-pro12.course.tamk.cloud/api/v1/items

* Endpoint for item 1: https://23wsp-pro12.course.tamk.cloud/api/v1/items/1
* Endpoint for item 2: https://23wsp-pro12.course.tamk.cloud/api/v1/items/2
* Endpoint for item 3: https://23wsp-pro12.course.tamk.cloud/api/v1/items/3

Other numbers will not not work since we only have 3 items in the backend api. Any other number will give this message:

```
{"message":"Not found"}
```

### How to run locally:


In order to run the code locally, run npm install in the appropriate folders (frontend and backend), after which by running the "npm start" command in the terminal, the frontend or backend will start functioning and will be accessible on your localhost via ports 3000 and 5000.

dependencies that need to be installed:


for backend dependencies:
```
npm install
```

for frontend dependencies:
```
npm install
```

------------------------

## Phases

**Phase 1**

Installing and creating boilerplates for backend and frontend:

    ```
    npx create-express-api -d backend
    ```
    ```
    npx create-react-app frontend
    ```

**Phase 2**

Created the needed dockerfiles and made sure that all containers are running and that its running in the local host properly.

**Phase 3**

In this phase two CI/CD pipelines were set up, with the following stages: test, build, and deploy. One in order to make sure that when posting something to main everything functions properly, and the other in order to make sure the code is working properly before a pull request can be made. To ensure functionality, we installed dependencies in both the backend and frontend folders. Before installing the required dependencies yourself, navigate to the correct folder from the main directory using 'cd backend' and 'cd frontend'.

for backend dependencies:
```
npm install
```

for frontend dependencies:
```
npm install
```

A remote server was taken into use in this phase and here the details for it:

* Server address: [address](https://23wsp-pro12.course.tamk.cloud/)
* the IP address: 172.16.6.26
    Ports:
    * frontend: 172.16.6.26:8000
    * backend 172.16.6.26:4000

Finally we created environmental secrets and adjusted branch protection via github.

**Phase 4**

In this phase, we created a Shopping List Application using React.js for the frontend. The frontend comprises a basic container that has all the required features. A functional API was also implemented to manage shopping list items, stored within an array. Upon opening the app, a set of sample items is displayed.

To add an item to the list, you can either click the plus sign or press Enter. Additionally, the application supports modifying item quantities through plus and minus buttons, as well as deleting items using the trash button. Each item has a bullet point, and clicking on the circle adds a checkmark, indicating that the item has been acquired.

At the end of the list, a total quantity is provided, giving users an overview of the total number of items on the list. Backend adjustments were made to handle GET, POST, and DELETE calls. The implementation of GET by ID allows for retrieving individual items from the API endpoint, with three default items currently available.

Furthermore, we've incorporated validation into the system through the use of a schema. This ensures that there is always a quantity associated with each item and that item names are required to be at least 1 letter long. Additionally, the validation prevents the quantity from going below 0; if such an attempt is made, the system will display an error message, enhancing the robustness and user-friendliness of the application.

For ease of testing and verification, a .rest file has been included, specifying the requests required for checking the functionality of the application.


**Phase 5**

In this phase, we've implemented custom tests on the backend to ensure the functionality of our system. These tests cover various aspects, including GET, POST, and DELETE functionalities. Additionally, we've included a singular PUT test, anticipating potential updates to the app that may introduce this functionality in the future.

In addition to the backend tests, we've incorporated a single custom frontend test. This particular test is designed to verify the correct display of the "shopping list" on the page. These tests collectively contribute to the comprehensive validation of both the backend and frontend, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of our application.
