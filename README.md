# Not fast just furious: Shopping list
> By Maria Kailahti and Nikola Simovic â”ƒ @mariakailahti @Nikola-Simovic

Welcome to our project for the Web Software Production course. We are developing a comprehensive shopping list application, showcasing our proficiency in full-stack development. Our project has a CI/CD system, using the tools and methods we learned in the course. This project represents our learning journey in full-stack development.

------------------------

## Server information

Server address: https://23wsp-pro12.course.tamk.cloud/

The IP address: 172.16.6.26
    
    
Ports:
* frontend: 172.16.6.26:8000 
* backend 172.16.6.26:4000


Endpoints:

### How to run locally: 


In order to run the code locally, run npm install in the appropriate folders (frontend and backend), after which by running the "npm start" command in the terminal, the frontend or backend will start functioning and will be accessible on your localhost via ports 3000 and 5000.

dependencies that need to be installed:


for backend dependencies:
```
npm install
```

for frontend dependencies:
```
npm install
```

------------------------

## Phases

**Phase 1**

Installing and creating boilerplates for backend and frontend:

    ```
    npx create-express-api -d backend
    ```
    ```
    npx create-react-app frontend
    ```

**Phase 2**

Created the needed dockerfiles and made sure that all containers are running and that its running in the local host properly.

**Phase 3**

In this stage two CI/CD pipelines were set up, with the following stages: test, build, and deploy. One in order to make sure that when posting something to main everything functions properly, and the other in order to make sure the code is working properly before a pull request can be made. To ensure functionality, we installed dependencies in both the backend and frontend folders. Before installing the required dependencies yourself, navigate to the correct folder from the main directory using 'cd backend' and 'cd frontend'.

for backend dependencies:
```
npm install
```

for frontend dependencies:
```
npm install
```

A remote server was taken into use in this phase and here the details for it:

* Server address: [address](https://23wsp-pro12.course.tamk.cloud/)
* the IP address: 172.16.6.26
    Ports:
    * frontend: 172.16.6.26:8000 
    * backend 172.16.6.26:4000

Finally we created environmental secrets and adjusted branch protection via github.

**Phase 4**
